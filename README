== What ==
jquery.simplePagination is a easy to use jquery widget to handle pagination of data.

== How To Use ==
Put 2 divs and a ul into the page that needs to be paginated. The UL should have the id "simple-pagination" and the divs will need the ids "simple-pagination-loading" and "simple-pagination-content". Be sure to put a call in the javascript section for the widget.

Here is a haml snippet.
:javascript
  $("#simple-pagination").simplePagination({url:"/appointments/2/notes/"});

%div#simple-pagination-loading
%div#simple-pagination-content
%ul#simple-pagination

Also you will need to make sure jQuery, jquery.simplePagination.js, and jquery.simplePagination.css are loaded.
